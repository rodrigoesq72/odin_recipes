        <li>Dried ancho chilies – 2</li>
        <li>Tomatoes – 2 large</li>
        <li>Onion – 1 large, quartered</li>
        <li>Garlic – 4 cloves</li>
        <li>Apple cider vinegar – 1/4 cup</li>
        <li>Bay leaves – 2-3</li>
        <li>Cloves – 2-3</li>
        <li>Cumin – 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Oregano – 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>Beef broth – 4 cups</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper – to taste</li>
        <li>Corn tortillas – 12-16</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese – 2 cups shredded (or Mexican cheese blend)</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro – for garnish</li>
        <li>Lime wedges – for serving</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>      
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the stems and seeds from the guajillo and ancho chilies. Soak them in hot water for 10-15 minutes until softened.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the softened chilies, tomatoes, garlic, onion, apple cider vinegar, cumin, oregano, and cloves. Blend into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Season the beef with salt and pepper, then sear it in a large pot until browned on all sides. Remove from the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add the chili paste and sauté for 5 minutes until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pot, add the bay leaves and beef broth, and bring everything to a boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2.5-3 hours, or until the beef is tender and easily shreds with a fork.</li>
        <li>Remove the beef from the pot, shred it, and set aside. Strain the broth to remove solids, creating the birria consomé.</li>
        <li>Heat a small amount of oil in a skillet. Dip each tortilla into the birria consomé, then place it on the skillet.</li>
        <li>Top each tortilla with shredded cheese and birria meat. Fold the tortilla in half and cook until crispy, flipping once.</li>
        <li>Serve the tacos hot with cilantro and lime wedges, and dip them into the remaining consomé for extra flavor.</li>
      </ol>
